# SpecWeaver — Origins & Acknowledgements

## Project Origin

SpecWeaver evolved from the **FlowManager** project, a configuration-driven workflow orchestration engine for AI-assisted software development.

- **Original repository**: [github.com/sbula/flowManager](https://github.com/sbula/flowManager)
- **Evolution**: FlowManager → SpecWeaver (March 2026)
- **What changed**: FlowManager focused on JSON workflow execution. SpecWeaver refocuses on the full specification-driven development lifecycle: spec drafting, validation, review, code generation, and quality assurance.
- **What was preserved**: The methodology framework (10-test battery, fractal decomposition, lifecycle layers), architectural analysis, and design decisions were carried forward. Valuable implementation knowledge was extracted into [flowmanager_legacy_reference.md](analysis/flowmanager_legacy_reference.md) before the old codebase was retired.

## Acknowledgements

### Cedric Mössner (TheMorpheus407)

Special thanks to **Cedric Mössner** ([TheMorpheus407](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407)) for sharing his work on the [DMZ ecosystem](https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/the-dmz) — a production-proven multi-agent development framework.

Key patterns adopted from DMZ into SpecWeaver's methodology:
- **SOUL.md** as a project constitution → SpecWeaver's Constitution Template
- **Read-only reviewer agents** with domain-specific checklists → SpecWeaver's Review system (F4/F7)
- **Automated issue creation from docs** (`auto-create-issues.sh`) → Influenced L2 Decomposition design
- **AGENTS.md / MEMORY.md** for agent governance → Influenced SpecWeaver's context management approach
- **15-point review checklist** → Basis for SpecWeaver's configurable review checklists

### Agentic Insights — Codebase Context Specification (CCS)

The [Codebase Context Specification](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/codebase-context-spec) (v1.1.0-RFC) by **Agentic Insights** established a community standard for embedding AI-readable metadata in codebases using `.context` directories with structured YAML/Markdown files.

SpecWeaver's `context.yaml` boundary manifest builds on CCS's foundation:
- **Adopted**: Hierarchical context files, `module-name`/`description`/`related-modules`/`architecture` fields, tool-agnostic philosophy
- **Extended**: Added enforcement fields (`archetype`, `consumes`, `forbids`, `exposes`, `constraints`) for algorithmic pre-code and post-code validation — turning passive documentation into active boundary enforcement

See [context_yaml_spec.md](architecture/context_yaml_spec.md) for the full specification.

### PasteMax — Token Budgeting & Prompt Formatting

[PasteMax](https://github.com/kleneway/pastemax) by **kleneway** is an open-source desktop tool for selecting repository files and preparing them as LLM context, with per-file token counting and model context limit awareness.

Ideas adopted into SpecWeaver's roadmap (Step 9, Phase 3):
- **Token budget awareness** (Step 9a) — estimating tokens before LLM calls using `tiktoken` with `len(text) // 4` fallback; warning when approaching model context limits
- **Structured prompt formatting** (Step 9b) — XML-tagged prompt assembly (`<file_map>`, `<file_contents>`, `<user_instructions>`) with per-file language detection; `PromptBuilder` pattern
- **Tiered file exclusion** (Phase 3.9) — 3-tier system: binary extensions, default patterns (`.git`, `__pycache__`), per-project overrides + `.specweaverignore`
- **File watcher** (Phase 3.10) — auto-re-validate specs on disk change

### Aider — AI Pair Programming Architecture

[Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) by **Paul Gauthier** is the leading open-source AI pair programming tool. Analyzed in March 2026 for prompt engineering, context management, and resilience patterns.

Patterns adopted or planned for SpecWeaver:
- **RepoMap with PageRank ranking** → Adaptation for spec topology context selection (9c): rank which specs are most relevant to the current context using dependency graph analysis, similar to Aider's symbol-based file ranking
- **Tiered context with trust signals** → PromptBuilder's `<file>` tags will include trust/role annotations (e.g., "reference-only" vs. "target for review"), inspired by Aider's `files_content_prefix` patterns
- **System reminder at end** → `.add_reminder()` method to re-state critical output format rules at the bottom of prompts, mitigating "lost in the middle" attention decay
- **Dynamic budget scaling** → When context is light, allocate more token budget to topology/context; when many files present, compress context — inspired by Aider's `map_mul_no_files` multiplier
- **Lint-fix reflection loop** → Step 12 (audit/quality gates): after code generation, run linter/tests → feed errors back to LLM for auto-fix → re-validate, with `max_reflections` cap. Directly from Aider's `reflected_message` + linter integration
- **Context overflow recovery** → Graceful handling when prompt exceeds model context window — auto-truncate and retry rather than failing. Inspired by Aider's `ContextWindowExceededError` handling
- **Auto spec-mention detection** → Scan LLM responses for spec/file names mentioned, auto-pull into context for follow-up calls. Inspired by Aider's `check_for_file_mentions()` (Phase 3.5)
- **Project metadata injection** → Inject project name, archetype, language target, date into system prompts. Inspired by Aider's `get_platform_info()` (Phase 3.7)
- **Conversation summarization** → Compress old multi-turn messages when context fills up, keeping recent turns + summary. Inspired by Aider's `summarize_end()` (Phase 4.6)
